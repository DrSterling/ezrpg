Save settings in database or INI file?
 - Game name <-- important! Must be used in templates by default

Module_EventLog
 - Check smarty docs to see how to loop through an array to display the logs


Ideas/features to implement after everything else:

Output buffering - file:///C:/Users/Andy/Documents/Docs/php/outcontrol.configuration.html

 Modules
 - Admin panel can select which modules to (de)activate
  - Transparent deactivation - gives 404 error if trying to access it (or redirect to index???)
 - List modules by searching through the modules directory for folders
 - Each module has its own folder
 
class.dbexception.php
 - Less string concats, make it one huge string (heredoc?)
